        Hi, my name is Maya Amit. I’m a fourth year Physics student at Northeastern University, with minors in Math and Data Science. My biggest passion is Astrophysics. Since the summer I’ve been a member of the SuperBIT (Super Pressure Balloon-Borne Imaging Telescope) Collaboration. Although I’m tackling physics related questions, data science has been a necessary part of my research. I’ve been working on an image analysis pipeline to analyze images of galaxy clusters that SuperBIT took last spring! Some other things about me –– My parents came to the US from Israel, and I was born and raised in the SF Bay Area. I speak Hebrew, I love cooking and running and science, and I did ballet for 15 years.
